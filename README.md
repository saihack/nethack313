==========

This is NetHack 3.1.3 patched to run on current Linux systems

The code is based on Vanilla-NetHack/NetHack@df89f069705251b66c74322ed01b3d30d670979e


Purpose of this project
-----------------------
Create a NetHack version for modern linux systems that is fun to play. 

Why 3.1.3?
----------

short answer: i like it


long answer: I like to play nethack, but I'm not a hardcore gamer. I like to have fun and a large part of the fun
playing nethack results from the fact that the player can use (or abuse) objects in creative ways. Over the years, the DevTeam classified
many of the creative things (think: going shopping, polypiling) as a bugs and removed them from the game. Also, a more complex
skill system has been introduced. For me, this reduced fun.

On the other hand, I really love the multi-dungeon features introduced with version 3.1. Therefore, I choose this version.
